## ATS Company/Facility Directory — C/FD

The Company/Facility Directory (C/FD) is designed to assist those who like
driving in [American Truck Simulator](https://americantrucksimulator.com/)
without the help of simulated GPS navigation.

The C/FD is a work in progress. Please check the discussion thread on the
SCS forum for further details:

Preview releases are also available from the

New preview releases may be expected several times a year.

#### Limitations of the license's applicability

Copyright and database law has some statutory exceptions (that may
differ by jurisdiction). If the law says whatever you want to do is
allowed, then obviously licenses needn't bother you. You do still need
to have legal reasoning though.

As you will have noticed, the C/FD largely constitutes a recording of
*facts*. Since copyright only protects *creative* activities, facts are
not copyrighted. However, the way in which the facts are systematically
presented in the C/FD *is* the result of a creative effort which also
has taken a significant investment of time to assemble. As such, the
C/FD *is* covered by copyright and related rights, even though the
pure facts it describes are not.

To free yourself from any C/FD license issues, you could always create
your own *truly independent* description of those facts, i.e. without
using or referencing the C/FD at all. Such independent works *will*
differ from each other in ways easy to detect for an expert. So it would
be possible to tell whether you copied from the C/FD (and are thus bound
by the CC By-NC-SA license terms), or whether your work is in fact the
result of an independent creative effort.

In 2022, I've made some of the content which later was added to the C/FD
available for reuse elsewhere. That content might perhaps be a possible
starting point for such an independent work. It still remains available
today under a slightly less restrictive license, but it's not maintained
by me and will likely become increasingly outdated as time passes. See
["User:Nautofon" on Fandom](https://truck-simulator.fandom.com/wiki/User:Nautofon)
for details.

Finally, if nothing else fits, asking me for an individual exception may
be a viable option. Feel free to get in touch.
