% The two engines we're currently targeting, latex and pdflatex, don't support
% Unicode output. So we might just as well use the ASCII expression \~n rather
% than its Unicode equivalent (event though utf8 inputenc is the default
% nowadays).
% Switching to lualatex or xelatex would likely allow Unicode output, which
% might be desireable because the tilde-n could then actually be copied onto
% the clipboard or be used in searches.
