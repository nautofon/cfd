\justifying

The Company/Facility Directory (C/FD) is designed to assist those who like driving in American Truck Simulator without the help of simulated GPS navigation.

This \textbf{early preview edition} only contains those three states for which the C/FD is already more or less complete.
Some \emph{in}complete additional content for other states is available separately as a supplement.

%This project is quite new and I don't really know yet where I'm going with it.
%Right now, the content structure is very similar to that of the wiki I used to upload these location descriptions to prior to February 2023.
%But it's not necessarily useful for it to stay that way.
%The idea is for the C/FD to be printable on paper---unlike the wiki, which was optimized to be viewed on a screen.
%Trading hypertext for a fixed canvas size brings both new challenges and opportunities.

%I don't know yet how the final edition of the C/FD will be structured and collated, nor what other content besides location descriptions it will eventually contain.
%Additionally, the visual design might change significantly from this early preview edition.
%This document has been typeset with \TeX, so it would even be relatively easy to produce multiple different versions---say, one for screen viewing, another one for printing.

The final edition of the C/FD may look very different from this early preview.
Future updates will be made available on the SCS forum.
Should you find this project interesting, please join the discussion!
