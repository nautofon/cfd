The Company/Facility Directory (C/FD) is designed to assist those who like driving in American Truck Simulator without the help of simulated GPS navigation.

This \textbf{early preview edition} only contains those ten states for which the C/FD is already more or less complete.
Some \emph{in}complete additional content for other states is available separately as a supplement.

The final edition of the C/FD may look very different from this early preview.
Future updates will be made available on the SCS forum.
Should you find this project interesting, please join the discussion!
